# Description 
- this is a short test I've created using ReactJs ES6 first.

- I think the 3hours is enough to create a simple version, but I think is more fun to spend my time creating something different.

- So this paginator has a splitter to long pagination, so you can pass how max tiles for pagination and how many pieces you would like to split, and then he will build custom pagination like image bellow with max tiles 15 and sliced in 3 parts.

# Includes
- Custom Pagination with resizable props to a different amount of tiles for large paginations.
- ApiService using Facade Pattern.
- ContextAPI to manage Cats context.
- Some hooks like useEffect, useCallback and useState.
- debounce to only reload pages when stop to click to prevent many requests to the server.
